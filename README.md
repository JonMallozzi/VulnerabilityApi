![example gif 1](vulnerabilityApi.gif)

#### A simple Java Spring Boot API to retrieve vulnerability data from the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds)

## Goal
Set up endpoints to quick get CVE Vulnerability data to learn about the latest vulnerabilities, see out standing vulnerabilities in a given software, and visualize common areas of attack.
On top of that this data is ready to fetch in any frontend to make interesting charts and diagrams. I see D3.js plus a React.js could make a fun project to present this data in visually pleasing way.
Lastly a big goal was to have the api be able to be self-hosted by anyone who pleases.

## Installation
Only requirement is a jdk 9 or greater installed. 
I used openjdk-17 so to run the api you might need downgrade the version in build and pom.xml to your version.

1. git clone the repository
2. cd into the cloned repository
3. mvn install 
4. mvn spring-boot:run 

Now the server is running locally waiting requests

## Documentation
[Java doc documentation for the api can be found on the project's git page or clicking this text](http://jonmallozzi.github.io/vulnerabilityapi)

## Endpoints
* get(/) - returns a JSON array of all the vulnerabilities &nbsp;
* get(/id/{id}) - returns the vulnerability that matches the id provided. if no vulnerability was found, the endpoint returns an empty JSON array &nbsp;
* get(/software/{software}) - a rough search of the CVE description value for the software name as that is not a field to find related CVEs. if no vulnerability was found, the endpoint returns an empty JSON array &nbsp;
* get(/v3/severity/{severity}) - returns all vulnerabilities that impact with a BaseMetricV3 baseSeverity that matches the provided value. if no vulnerability was found, the endpoint returns an empty JSON array  &nbsp;
* get(/v2/severity/{severity}) - returns all vulnerabilities that impact with a BaseMetricV2 severity that matches the provided value. if no vulnerability was found, the endpoint returns an empty JSON array  &nbsp;
* get(/v3/attackVector/{attackVector}) - returns all vulnerabilities that have a matching BaseMetricV3 attackVector. if no vulnerability was found, the endpoint returns an empty JSON array &nbsp;
* get(/v2/accessVector/{accessVector}) - returns all vulnerabilities that have a matching BaseMetricV2 accessVector. if no vulnerability was found, the endpoint returns an empty JSON array &nbsp;
*post(/multiple) - takes an JSON array of vulnerabilities in the body and saves them &nbsp;
* post(/) - takes a JSON object of a vulnerability in the body and saves it. Throws a VulnerabilityAlreadyExists exception if there already exists a vulnerability for the provided id &nbsp;
* put(/) - takes a JSON object of a vulnerability in the body and replaces the store values with provided vulnerability. Throws a VulnerabilityDoesNotExist exception if no vulnerability was found with a matching id &nbsp;
* delete(/{id}) - Deletes the vulnerability with matching id as the one provided. Throws a VulnerabilityDoesNotExist exception if no vulnerability was found with a matching id &nbsp;

## Future Plans
* Add H2 and JPA for in memory database storage of the vulnerability data
* Add a system fetch and keep the vulnerability up to date
* Add Postgres Storage, authentication, a React visualization frontend app, and host the fullstack app on a VPS
